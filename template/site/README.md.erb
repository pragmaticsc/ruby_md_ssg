Generated by Ruby MD SSG <%= gem_version %>.

## Commands

- `bundle exec ruby_md_ssg build` — regenerate the site into `build/` (writes `sitemap.xml`)
- `bundle exec ruby_md_ssg serve` — serve `build/` with automatic rebuilds
- `bundle exec ruby_md_ssg menu` — refresh `docs/menu.yml`
- `bundle exec ruby_md_ssg test` — run the Minitest suite (if present)

Set `RUBY_MD_SSG_BASE_URL` (or pass `--base-url`) when building to control sitemap URLs.
Set `RUBY_MD_SSG_BASE_PATH` (or pass `--base-path`) when deploying under a subdirectory (e.g., GitHub Pages project sites).

Docs live in `docs/`, assets in `assets/`, templates in `templates/`.

GitHub Pages deployment is configured via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`; adjust the workflow or remove it if you handle deployments differently.
